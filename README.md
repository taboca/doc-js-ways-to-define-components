# Mess about the ways to define components 

According to SHubham Khatri [2017 StackOverflow], there is a functional component approach, that can be used when your component only takes in props and renders the result directly:

```
const Main = () => { 
   return(<h1>my title</h1>)
}
```

However, there is also the ES6 class based approach, that can be used when the React component has more functionality and handles states:

```
class Main extends React.Component {
   render(){ return(<h1>something</h1>}
}
```
